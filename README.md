## Starting a new project

First, make sure you have [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) installed. If you are using OS X, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) can take care of that for you:

	brew install cookiecutter

Cookiecutter templates can be installed directly from GitHub. Navigate to the directory where you want your project to be created and run:

    cookiecutter gh:istrategylabs/mo-django
    
Navigate to your project and link it to github with:

    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:organization/project-name.git
    git commit -am 'Mo init'
    git push
